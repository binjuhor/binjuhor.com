The Vow is a professional wedding house with many studios for difference themes and sceneries for photography. Each studio provides a difference artwork space for the wedding, ceremony photoshoot and artwork design. As a development from Marry Me Elegant Wedding & Celebration Wordpress Theme, the Vow website looks stunning in elegant and bright colours. 

Smart scroll allows the viewer to keep looking to one mainframe while the whole site slides up and down following user scrolling. Based on a light theme, Beaucreative designs a lovely red ribbon for the brand name to highlight the ultimate goal of the Vow: A place to memorize happy moments. Photographer and wedding planner portfolios are displayed clearly, continuously to attract the viewer and make them keep scrolling down.
